To the Fetch Data Analytics Team,

I’m excited to be applying for the Senior Data Analyst position at Fetch. As someone who understands and appreciates the value of earning rewards and discounts from trusted brands—especially during this latest era of inflation—I know firsthand how impactful a rewards platform like Fetch can be for consumers. With over six years of experience as a data analyst and a strong technical foundation, I’m eager to help Fetch teams leverage and monetize actionable insights from your unique datasets.

In my current role as a Senior Data Analyst at Everly Health, I’ve worn many hats while being a part of a growth-stage med-tech startup navigating post-pandemic challenges.  Some highlights of my work include blending disparate databases following company mergers to streamline reporting mart schemas, building QA checks and automated flags for ops teams, developing forecast models for finance, and partnering with engineering to ensure robust data tracking for new product launches. I’ve also worked closely with account managers and marketing teams to create educational resources and ensure that our analytics tools empower them to act quickly and strategically. These experiences taught me how to balance technical innovation with practical application, always keeping the needs of end users front and center.

My technical skills include advanced SQL proficiency (with tools like Snowflake and Redash), utilization of python where needed, automating ETL pipelines, and expertise in visualization platforms like Looker and Tableau. Most recently, I spearheaded the development of member engagement metrics to identify optimal outreach combinations and cadence based on communication methods and demographics, driving improvements with return rates and retention. Additionally, my background has instilled in me a strong adaptability and a focus on scale—skills that align with Fetch’s vision for this role.

Fetch’s mission to empower consumers to live rewarded throughout their day resonates with me. I’m thrilled by the prospect of working in a fast-paced environment where technical expertise, creativity, and collaboration intersect. I’d love to bring my experience and enthusiasm to your Data Analytics team to help drive the next phase of growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with Fetch’s vision.

Best regards,
Colton (aka Cole)
